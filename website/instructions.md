# Creating and Utilizing Custom Capes in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

This document outlines the process for creating and implementing custom capes within Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. By following these guidelines, users can personalize their in-game appearance with unique cape designs.

## I. Creating Your Custom Cape Pack

To begin using custom capes, you will first need to create a cape pack containing your desired designs. Follow the steps below:

### A. Setting Pack Information

1.  **Naming Your Pack:** Assign a distinct and descriptive name to your cape pack. This name will be visible within the game's settings.
2.  **Adding a Description:** Provide a brief description for your pack. This information can offer further context or details about the included capes.

### B. Uploading Cape Designs

1.  **Image Requirements:** Upload one or more images to be used as your custom capes. For optimal visual fidelity, adhere to the following specifications:
    * **File Format:** PNG (.png)
    * **Dimensions:** 128×64 pixels
    * **Background:** Ensure the background of your cape design is transparent to allow for proper rendering in-game.

### C. Previewing and Customizing

1.  **3D Model Viewer:** Utilize the integrated 3D model viewer to preview how your uploaded cape designs will appear on the Minecraft character model. This allows for real-time adjustments and ensures the desired aesthetic.

### D. Downloading and Installing

1.  **Download .mcpack File:** Once you are satisfied with your cape pack, download it as an `.mcpack` file. This is the standard package format for Minecraft Bedrock Edition content.
2.  **Automatic Import:** Open the downloaded `.mcpack` file. This action will automatically import the cape pack into your Minecraft Bedrock Edition installation. Your custom capes will then be accessible within the game's appearance settings.

## II. Designing Effective Capes

To ensure your custom capes are displayed correctly and look visually appealing in Minecraft, consider the following design principles:

### A. Size Considerations

* The recommended and standard size for cape images is **128×64 pixels**. While other dimensions may be used, the game will automatically resize them, potentially leading to undesirable stretching or distortion.

### B. Transparency Management

* Maintaining transparency in the appropriate areas of your cape design is crucial for proper in-game rendering. Only the central, non-transparent portion of the image will be visible as the actual cape. Ensure any parts you wish to be see-through are saved as transparent pixels in your PNG file.

### C. Utilizing the Design Template

* To guarantee your design aligns correctly with the Minecraft character model's cape geometry, it is highly recommended to download and utilize the provided cape template. This template will guide you in positioning your design elements effectively.

### D. Naming Conventions

* Each individual cape within your pack must have a unique name. This name should adhere to the following restrictions:
    * Allowed characters: lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).
    * Disallowed characters: spaces and any other special characters.

## III. Frequently Asked Questions

### A. Visibility to Other Players

* **Question:** Will other players be able to see my custom capes in-game?
* **Answer:** No, these custom capes are **client-side only**. This means that only you, the player who has installed the custom cape pack, will be able to see your chosen cape in your own game. Other players will see your character with their default cape or no cape, depending on their own settings.

### B. Compatibility with Minecraft Pocket Edition

* **Question:** Does this method of creating and using custom capes work with Minecraft Pocket Edition?
* **Answer:** Yes, this process is compatible with **all versions of Minecraft Bedrock Edition**, including those on mobile devices (formerly known as Minecraft Pocket Edition), consoles, and Windows 10/11. The `.mcpack` format is designed for seamless integration across all Bedrock Edition platforms.

### C. Compatibility with Minecraft Java Edition

* **Question:** Does this method of creating and using custom capes work with Minecraft Java Edition?
* **Answer:** no, this process is only compatible with **all versions of Minecraft Bedrock Edition**, including those on mobile devices (formerly known as Minecraft Pocket Edition), consoles, and Windows 10/11. The `.mcpack` format is designed for seamless integration across all Bedrock Edition platforms, not Java mods.
