## Overview

`CapeExample` is a resource pack for Minecraft: Pocket Edition (Bedrock Edition on mobile devices). This pack aims to [clearly and concisely describe what the resource pack changes or adds to the game. Examples: "improve the visual appearance of capes," "add new and unique cape designs," "provide a base for custom cape creation," etc.].

## Installation

To install and use the `CapeExample` resource pack in Minecraft: Pocket Edition, follow these steps:

1.  **Download the Pack:** Obtain the `.mcpack` file (if you package it this way) or the zipped folder containing the assets. If you haven't packaged it, users will download the repository as a zip.

2.  **Import the Pack (if `.mcpack`):**
    * If you have a `.mcpack` file, simply tap on it. Minecraft: Pocket Edition should automatically open and import the resource pack.

3.  **Import the Pack (if zipped folder):**
    * **Android:** Use a file explorer to locate the downloaded zip file. Extract the contents of the zip file. Move the extracted folder (which should contain the `manifest.json` file) to the following directory on your device: `Internal storage/games/com.mojang/resource_packs/`.
    * **iOS:**
        * Connect your iOS device to a computer.
        * Open iTunes or Finder (on macOS Catalina or later).
        * Navigate to your device, then to "File Sharing," and select Minecraft.
        * Add the extracted folder (containing `manifest.json`) to the `resource_packs` folder.

4.  **Activate the Pack in Minecraft:**
    * Open Minecraft: Pocket Edition.
    * Go to **Settings**.
    * Scroll down and tap on **Global Resources**.
    * Under "Available," find the `CapeExample` pack and tap **Activate**. It will move to the "Active" section.
    * Alternatively, you can activate the pack for a specific world when creating or editing a world under the "Resource Packs" section.

5.  **Enjoy!** Launch or enter a world where the resource pack is active to see the changes.

## Usage

Once the `CapeExample` resource pack is activated, any capes in the game should be affected by the changes you've made. This might include:

* **New Cape Textures:** Players with capes might see the new designs you've added.
* **Modified Default Cape:** The default cape appearance might be altered.

## Content of the Pack

The repository structure (as seen) likely contains:

* `textures/models/armor/elytra.png`: This directory should contain the image files for your custom cape textures (e.g., `.png` files).
* `manifest.json`: This crucial file defines the resource pack for Minecraft, including its name, version, and UUID.
* `pack_icon.png` (optional): This is the icon that will represent your resource pack in the Minecraft settings.
* `LICENSE`: Contains the licensing information for your pack.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new cape designs or improvements, feel free to:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your ideas.
3.  Make your changes to the texture files.
4.  Submit a pull request with a description of your additions.
